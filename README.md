My journey through CS50 in 2020.

Problem set 0
 
 Scratch - monkey chases a muffin - can add "more" by having the monkey always go toward the muffin directly instead of moving to the same y-axis, have the monkey move faster and faster. Some amount of lives or bites of the muffin allowed before game over 

Problem set 1

  Hello - simple hello world type program
  Mario - build a right aligned # pyramid the height of user input 1-8 - 3 style errors
  Cash - determine the lowest amount of coins that can be given for set amount of change

Triangle - created a function. Determine whether 3 lengths can form a valid triangle

Problem set 2

 Readability - determine the reading grade level of given text - can update to combine 3 functions into a single if/if else loop, so the code is only looping through the text once rather than 3 times
